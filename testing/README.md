The focus of this test suite is validation of the customer experience.

### Installation

The installation should follow the same steps every time.
The user can uninstall their application.
The user can re-install application.

### Presentation Layer
This suite will go over common activities for 
1. a non-authenticated user
1. a authenticate user

### Test accounts
To make test cases repeatable, a series of test accounts will need to be maintained.
Some database processes might be needed to manage test accounts.


### Automation
The strategy for automation is in progress, I would like to setup manual test cases prior to automation.

### Branching
Let's create a branch called "testing" where we will stage tests in progress or creation prior to merging those tests into the main branch.
