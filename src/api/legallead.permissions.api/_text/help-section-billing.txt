  <h2>🛠️ Billing: How Our Billing Works</h2>
  <p>Welcome to our billing information page. 
  The goal is to be transparent about the billing for the software and services.</p>

  <h4>✅ Step 1. Initial Setup and Account Representative Support Fee:</h4>
  <p>A one-time initial fee is required to set up an account.
This fee covers the initial configuration of the software and includes support from a dedicated account representative to ensure a smooth onboarding process.
This initial setup may involve data migration and tailoring the software to specific requirements, depending on the complexity of implementation.</p>
  
  <h4>✅ Step 2: Ad-Hoc Search Billing (Pay-Per-Record):</h4>
  <p>After the initial setup, software usage is billed on an ad-hoc basis.
A fee will be charged for each record searched within the software.
This allows control over costs and the ability to scale usage based on business needs.
The aim is to provide a fair and transparent pricing structure that reflects the value received from using the software.</p>
  
  <h4>✅ Step 3: Billing Cycle and Invoices:</h4>
  <p>Invoices are generated on a per request basis.
The invoice will detail the initial setup fee (if applicable) and a breakdown of ad-hoc search usage, including the number of records searched and the corresponding cost.
Payment is due within 30 days of the invoice date.</p>

  <h4>❓ Questions or Concerns:</h4>
  <p>Contact your account representative or the customer support team with any billing questions.</p>
